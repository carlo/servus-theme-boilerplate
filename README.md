# Servus: Theme Boilerplate

[Servus][servus] is a Mac app to make quick-fire sharing via your
[Dropbox account][dropbox] easier and more comfortable.  Its preferences allow
you to specify a custom theme for rendering your shared files' preview pages.

This repository contains a bare-bones theme starter kit: a `index.html` with
all the available placeholders.  Feel free to use it as boilerplate for your
custom themes.


## How to get started

1. Either [download starter kit as ZIP file][boilerplate-zip] (then unzip
    it) **or** [fork the starter kit repo on Github][boilerplate-github].
    Store the resulting folder somewhere on the Mac that has Servus installed.
2. Tell Servus to use that starter kit folder as custom theme.  To do that,
    open Servus' Preferences window, go to the _Theme_ section and tick the
    box labelled _"Use custom theme…"_, then set the theme folder by pressing
    the _"Select theme path"_ button.
3. Now when you drop a file onto the Servus icon, the app will get its theme
    files from that starter kit folder.
4. To edit your theme, open the starter kit folder and edit the `index.html`
    as you see fit.  If you want to add new elements like CSS files or
    background images, drop them into that same folder and reference them in
    your HTML and CSS files as usual.  (See the section "Important!" below.
    It's important!)
5. Drop any file onto the Servus menubar icon to see your theme changes.


## Templating Engine

Servus is making use of [Mustache][mustache], a well-known logic-less
templating engine.  You can find all you need to know about its syntax on the
[Mustache website][mustache].


## Theme Workflow

The templating process works like this:

1. The contents of your local theme folder will be copied to a
    temporary folder.
2. All asset files in that folder are uploaded.  (Asset files are
    images, Javascript files, etc. — basically everything that's
    neither a CSS file nor the `index.html`.)
3. Shareable links for those files are requested from the Dropbox
    API.
4. In the CSS files and `index.html` the original references to the
    local asset files are replaced with their respective shareable
    counterparts gathered in step 3.
    As an example, let's assume in your CSS file you reference a
    local theme file `background-image.jpg`.  Since each file shared
    via Dropbox gets its own unpredictable path name by the Dropbox
    API, your local reference to that file won't work anymore, so
    Servus is replacing it with the file's shareable URL
    `https://dl.dropbox.com/s/1234567890abcde/background-image.jpg`.
5. The CSS files are uploaded, their references are replaced in the
    `index.html`.
6. The HTML file is uploaded.


## Important!

- Your theme **must** contain an `index.html`.
- Your theme can contain more than one CSS file and many JS files
  but only *one* `index.html`.  The templating engine won't replace
  placeholders in JS files, tho, so if you want to set JS variables,
  do so in a `<script>` block in the HTML file prior to loading your
  external JS file.
- Servus will ignore subfolders.  Only files in the root folder of
  your theme are recognized and processed.
- The templating engine expects UTF-8 encoded files.
- All your external assets should be served via HTTPS.


## Template Placeholders

Here's a list of available template keys/variables with their
meaning.

- `file_link`: the relative path to the shared file as seen from
  `index.html`.
- `file_ext`: the normalized file extension (trimmed & lowercase).
- `file_size`: the file size in readable format, eg. "2.70 KB",
  "5.12 GB".
- `original_filename`: The name of the file as it was when the file
  was shared.
- `is_archive`: the file is an archive (zip, tgz, rar etc.)
- `is_audio`: the file is an audio file (mp3, m4a, wav etc.)
- `is_contact`: the file is a vcard file
- `is_image`: the file is an image (png, jpg, tiff, gif etc.)
- `is_message`: the file is a recognized message (email, IM, and so
  on)
- `is_pdf`: the file is a mixed content file, i.e. a PDF.
- `is_text`: the file is text document (html, rtf, mdown etc.)
- `is_video`: the file is a video (mov, mpg etc.)
- `is_unknown_type`: the file wasn't recognized as one of the files
  listed above
- `is_ext_*`: a "dynamic" placeholder — for example, if the shared
  file is a GIF then the placeholder `is_ext_gif` would be set.
- `dropbox_preview_link`: the URL to Dropbox' original preview page
  for the shared file.  (Servus 1.0+)
- `json_data`: all available keys/variables as JSON object.
  Naturally, this is what you want to use when writing Javascript.
- `preview_image`: the URL to an JPG containing a rendered presentation of
  your uploaded file.  Max. image size is 512x512px.  (Servus 1.3+)
